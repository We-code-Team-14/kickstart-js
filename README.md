# HOW'S IT GROWING

## About the App

This is an app for Growing Gardens community members to come together and share resources. The user can create an account to access the forum, view posts by other community members, and can post to the forum. We see this as a way to create a thriving sharing community, where goods and resources can be shared to those in need. This is also a way to track the progress and measure the impact Growing Gardens has on the community.

## Things We Would Build in the Future

- Build out a filtering system with icons for usability purposes.

- Members can comment on posts and reply to one another.

- Facilitators of correctional facilities would have access to the app and can post on the inmates behalf.

- Recipe creator based on ingredients that one has.

- A growing calendar page with updates on best growing periods.

- Ability to choose a language and have all content translated automatically.

## How to Deploy

Clone the repo

Navigate to your local repo

```
cd /Users/mycomp/Documents/kickstart-js
```

Press return, and you'll be taken to that folder.

Install [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) globally. (Debug hint: run this even if you think you have nodemon.)

```
npm i nodemon -g
```

Install server and client dependencies. Running the `yarn` command will install all of the dependancies listed in package.json. Since this project contains both server and client side apps, this needs to be run both in the root folder and in the client folder.

```
yarn
cd client
yarn
```

For local development, start the server and client at the same time (from the root of the project)

```
yarn dev
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ and try adding an item to your To Do list
