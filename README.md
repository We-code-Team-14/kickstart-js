# HOW'S IT GROWING

## About the App

This is an app for Growing Gardens community memebers to come together and share resources. The user can create an account to access the forum, view posts by other community members, and can post to the fourm. We see this as a way to create a thriving sharing community, where goods and resources can be shared to those in need. This is also a way to track the progress and measure the impact Growing Gardens has on the community. 

## Things We Would Build in the Future

- Build out a filtering system with icons for usability purposes.

- Members can comment on posts and reply to one another. 

- Facilitators of correctional facilities would have access to the app and can post on the inmates behalf. 

- Recpie creator based on ingredients that one has.

- A growing calander page with updates on best growing periods.

- Ability to choose a language and have all content translated automatically.
